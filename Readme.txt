Path to success,
1. Compile the file CreatePoolFile.cpp to get cpf.exe or similar.
2. Run the command cpf.exe TEX_STRING rstex.cpp.pre rstex.h.pre.
   Make sure that after this step you have the three files
   rstex.cpp, rstex.h, and tex.pool.
3. Compile rstex.cpp to get rstex.exe or similar.
4. Make sure all files the program needs, including tex.pool
   are located in the same directory as the program itself.
   (Note: see win/unix specific versions to avoid having all files in the same directory)
5. Run the command rstex.exe.
6. Celebrate!
